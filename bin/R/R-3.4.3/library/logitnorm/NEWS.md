# logitnorm 0.8.33

## New features

### density on log-scale 

Thanks to @madeleine-empirical the density function `dlogitnorm` now has `log` an argument that allows computing the density directly at log-scale.


## Further changes

### Migration to github

The hosting of the development moved from r-forge to github. Releases will still be put to r-forge, because of its good package-checking setup for several platforms, and the help for submission to CRAN, but versioning and development of the code will be done on github. 

### Documentation

A package vignette, a README.Rmd and this NEWS.md file have been added.
