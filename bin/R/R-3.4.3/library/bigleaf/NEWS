NEWS for Package 'bigleaf'

version 0.6.1 (2018-04-18)

 - default names for 'formulation' arguments changed for clarity in surface.conductance() 
   and decoupling(). "PenmanMonteith" is changed to "Penman-Monteith", "FluxGradient" to 
   "Flux-Gradient", and "JarvisMcNaughton_1986" to "Jarvis&McNaughton_1986".


version 0.6.0 (2018-04-18)

 - function reference.ET() is now covered by potential.ET(). If 'approach=Penman-Monteith',
   potential ET is calculated according to the Penman-Monteith equation (as previously
   in reference.ET()). Argument 'Gs_pot' (formerly 'Gs_ref') is given in mol m-2 s-1
   and defaults to 0.6 mol m-2 s-1.
   

version 0.5.2 (2018-04-10)
  - Gb output in aerodynamic.conductance and Gb functions renamed to Gb_h to clarify
    that values correspond to heat transfer. Same for Rb and kB.


version 0.5.1 (2018-04-09)

  - results of additional quantities (for which Sc is provided) are expressed as 
    conductances instead of resistances in aerodynamic.conductance()
  - 'data' included as argument in radiometric.surface.temp()
  - calculation of 'nr_data' accounts for missing values in Gamma if model=Leuning
    (function stomatal.slope())
    

version 0.5.0 (2018-04-06)

  - wind.profile() function restructured. z0m can be provided or calculated from
    the logarithmic wind profile equation
  - reflectance of downwelling longwave radiation is now accounted for in the 
    calculation of radiometric surface temperature (function radiometric.surface.temp())
  - variable 'LW_down' added to dataset DE_Tha_Jun_2014
  - argument 'calc.surface.CO2' removed from intercellular.CO2()
  

version 0.4.6 (2018-04-05)

  - important bugfix concerning several functions: all required arguments are passed
    to nested functions
  - argument 'N' in aerodynamic.conductance() now defaults to 2 as in Gb.Su()


version 0.4.5 (2018-03-16)

  - variables 'LW_up' (upward longwave radiation) and 'Reco' (ecosystem respiration)
    were added to all three example datasets
  - bug fix to 'surface.conditions' and 'pressure.from.elevation' regarding the 
    'Esat.formulation' argument. In 'Esat.formulation', this argument is not
	  implemented and the default formulation is taken for all calculations.
  
  

version 0.4.4 (2018-03-13)

  - 'reference.ET': argument Gs renamed to Gs_ref

	  
version 0.4.3 (2018-03-12)

  - Function 'bigleaf.constants' restructured in a way that allows 
    changing the constants for each function call


version 0.4.2 (2018-03-12)

  - constants (a,b,c) from Allen et al. 1998 added as option to 'Esat.slope'
   	(pull request from Rémi Vezy)
  - Argument 'Esat.formula' added to every function that calculates esat
    or slope of esat to allow consistency among functions.  
  - 'light.response': argument "..." added to the nls function
  - 'stomatal.slope': argument "..." within each call of nls in the function	
  
		 
version 0.4.1 (2018-03-08)

  - aerodynamic.conductance: Ga_CO2 added to function output 


version 0.4.0 (2018-03-08)

  - 'aerodynamic.conductance': Rb can be calculated for other quantities if 
    the respective Schmidt number is provided. I.e. new arguments "Sc" and
    "Sc_name" as the value of the Schmidt number, and the name of the quantity
 	  for which Sc is provided, respectively.
  - 'bigleaf.constants': Prandtl number (Pr) and Schmidt number for CO2 (Sc_CO2)
     added
  - 'light.response': bug fix: +Reco replaced by -Reco (sign was reversed)
		 
		 
version 0.3.2 (2018-03-06)	
	 
  - rH.to.VPD: if statement vectorized (thanks to Rémi Vezy)
  - radiometric.surface.temp: Output renamed	("." replaced by "_")

	   
version 0.3.1 (2018-02-09)		  

  - Monin.Obukhov.length: default arguments added
